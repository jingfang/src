たとえばこれ！

# Can you introduce your self within 3 minutes?
I'm chinese brought up in Japan. 
I speak native level of Japanese, business level in English and Chinese.
I'm interested in working international environment.

I was actually going to be a physicist when in my university days, 
but I had chance to make and exhibit a cute gadget in SXSW, after that experience I was fascinated by making product, so I decide to change my career into IT industry.
I'm a self taught programmer throught self-study and a lot of side projects and internship including Google and Sony.

With those engineering skills, I joined Japanese company Recruit as product analyst and product manager.
I was working on the matching engine which matches jobseeker to the job opportunity through their resume and past activity on the job search website like Indeed.
I was the one who looked into the data and find growth opportunity, and then translated them into initiatives and the software requirements.

As my side business I also own my own company which makes microscope platform for the laboratry automation. This platform provides ready to use and very flexible interface for those who want to automate the biological experiments. 
I'm making this product with my hudsband. I'm in charge of the software, he in hardware. of course we will help each other.
Recently, I succeeded to use the natural language to command this microscope, and I'm interested in building a good chat interface for people to interact with this microscope with natural language.

# Reason for leaving
first of all, I'm greateful for Recruit for giving me this great opportunity to build my career as a product manager, and also I had some invaluable handson experience as a product manager.
however while after my experience in recruit, I found my current position is not in line of my career development.
cutting-edge technologyを使ったpoduct managerになりたい
recruitは確立されたテクノロジーをドメインに適用してビジネスをenhanceすることがうまい。そのバランスを勉強できてよかった。
でも、私はもっと最先端のテクノロジーを使って未来を作りたい。テクノロジーを適用するだけでなくて、curve the technology.
特に、最近のLLMに興味がある。

さらに、そのためには、本当に新しいものを作るには、自分で手を動かす必要があると思う
マーケットを理解するだけでなくて、技術を触って、理解する必要がある
さらに、cutting-edgeな世界で良いプロダクトを作ると言うことは、素晴らしいiteration cycleを作ることと非常に近いと思う
そこまで含めて取り組みたい。
Siri understandingに参加したい
https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200322178/aiml-sr-software-engineer-siri-understanding?team=SFTWR

apple ただテクノロジーを追求するんではなくて、真に人が喜ぶものを作っている
さらに、この素晴らしいテクノロジーリープをproductionに取り入れない訳が無いと思う。
だから、今appleに参加して、素晴らしいengineeringとproduct developmentが融合する世界で働きたい

First of all, I am grateful to Recruit for giving me the opportunity to build my career as a product manager and for the invaluable hands-on experience I gained in that role. However, after my time at Recruit, I found that my current position was not aligned with my career development goals. I want to become a cutting-edge technology product manager who can not only apply established technologies to enhance business but also curve the technology and create the future. While Recruit excels at applying established technologies to domains, I am more interested in working with the latest and most advanced technologies, particularly in the field of LLM.

To achieve this goal, I believe that I need to be hands-on with technology and not just understand it from a market perspective. Creating great products in a cutting-edge world is closely tied to building a great iteration cycle, and I want to be part of that. I am particularly interested in joining the Siri Understanding team at Apple because I want to be part of creating something truly innovative that people will love.

Moreover, I am drawn to Apple because it does not simply pursue technology for technology's sake, but creates products that truly make people happy. I believe that there is no reason not to incorporate this incredible technology leap into production, and that is why I want to join Apple now and work in a world where engineering and product development are fused together.


# what is your strength and weakness

Strengths:

- I am an independent thinker and a highly self-motivated individual. I am good at engaging with people and understanding the environment, which allows me to set my own goals that are both inspiring for myself and aligned with those around me.
- I am a self-taught person and a fast learner, with a great amount of curiosity and a desire to learn more.
- I am an effective cross-functional and cross-cultural communicator. I understand the motivations and interests of stakeholders, and I can find solutions or compromises that respect all of them.

Weaknesses:
I tend to have difficulty sustaining long-term projects or goals on my own. I need the support of others and seek out like-minded individuals who share my values and goals. In situations where I cannot find such individuals, I may lower my priorities or even abandon a project altogether. Therefore, I would like to find environments where I can connect with many supportive and like-minded individuals.


<!-- strength
- individual thinker, highly self starter. good at talk to people and understand the environment, and then set my own goal which will both aspiring for myself, and align to the people around
- self taught person, fast learner with great amount of curiousity.
- good cross function & cross cultural communicator. understand the motivation and 利害 of stakeholders, and find a solution which respect all of them.

weakness
- 一人で長く続けられない。仲間が必要。仲間を見つけられなかったものは、たとえ価値を感じてても優先順位を下げた上にやめてしまう。良い仲間がたくさん得られる環境に行きたい。 -->


# Can you tell me more about your background and experience?

2 experiences I want to focus






Sure, as a pro


I also working on helping to increase the diversity of the university of tokyo. Most of the projects are currently underground project, but I want university to have the quantitative goal for the gender diversity, and I want to make a "コンソーシアム" to help the university to acheive this with support from "学生団体", "卒業生団体", "協賛企業".
I'm kind of the producer and project manager of this half-underground projects.


answer to these questions.

# have you worked with difficult people? how do you deal with difficult people.

- 2タイプある
1. difficult to communicate as a personality
PMとして気負いすぎて失敗した
situation: need to launch a new model using a taxonomy in 3 monthes. This result was to be used for decision making of whether we should invest on taxonomy in next year.
task: help data scientists and engineer articulate their idea, decide priority of ideas to try, and then set miletones and roadmaps to show the impact of taxonomy.
action: One of team member insist on the we need data clensing to start the project. And we failed to define the minimum requirement of the "clensing", so the project got stuck. At that point I realise in the team we didn't have a person who can make dicision on the best balance of clensing, so I asked for help for senior data scientist around.
result: the project successfuly proved the importance of the taxonomy, but the member of the team was very tired not in good way. half of the project member decide not to continue on this project.


結果的に、解決ができる人にプロジェクトを助けてもらうことでプロジェクトは解決したが、メンバーはうまくいかず、半分の人がその後プロジェクトから外れてしまった

2. difficult to communicate in the sense of decision making and goal oriented actions
大学は、目的を達成する組織では全くない
基本的に今やっていることから改善していくことが中心で、ゴールをセットして、現時点をmeasureして、そこのギャップを定量的にみていく、と言うやり方について、理解はすれど、「無理」だから積み上げ式で、と言う感じになってしまう

マインドセット
- 意思決定者になることを恐れている　→ 全体の会議での合意を設計する
- やってみせてしめす。
- 全く意味がないと思うものは誠実に指摘したり、優先順位を下げるようにサポートする
- inclusionが大事なので、営利会社ではやらないようなことでも、積極的にやりたい人がいたら、適切な境界を置くことをサポートする

# career goal and interests

キャリアにおける追求したい軸
- 技術の社会実装
- dynamicsを読み解いて、ゴールに向かって人々の力を合わせること

リクルートでは特に後者について学ばせてもらった。
- HR product manager. Lead a AI matching team in Recruit agent and Indeed + start a collaboration between Indeed and Recruit.
- lanuching university diversity program at university of Tokyo

向こう5年は、この爆発的なAIをどう社会にimplementしていくか、どう人の役に立たせるか、どう安全にハンドルしていくか、と言うことに興味がある
特に、ここ5年でやれたら嬉しいのは、

この言語理解を生かして、
本当に人の意図を汲み取ってアクションしてくれる音声インターフェースを設計したい
ここ数ヶ月LLMのchainをいじった結果、今後賢くて人のように柔軟にサポートしてくれるAIは、モデルのワンショットではなくて、思考のチェーンを表現したAI chainからなると思う
そのようなAI engineeringは、新しいsoftware engineering practiceによって支えられると思う
素晴らしい音声assistantの構築は、新しいbest practice of engineeringと切り離せないものになると思う
AppleはSiriがあるし、iphoneで目もあるから、新しいプロダクトを作ったらどんどん展開して使ってもらえるんじゃないかと思うし、そこのマジックを持っているように感じる
そういう環境で次の世代の新しいAIプロダクトたちを作っていきたい
